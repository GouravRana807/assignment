        <p>They're in their 80s and 90s, their brains are riddled with plaque&hellip;</p>
        <p>So why on earth do this select group of seniors have such incredible memories?</p>
        <p>In fact, why are they called "Cognitive Super Agers" &mdash; a term coined by Dutch scientists to categorize the top 1% of seniors whose brains never seem to fade.</p>
        <p>Strangely enough, the answer isn't genetics&hellip;</p>
        <p>It's not memory supplements, or drugs, or anything else you're thinking of&hellip;</p>

        <p>Instead, shocking new research suggests that the real reason this small group of seniors have iron-clad memories&hellip;</p>
        <p>Has to do with tiny "power cells" inside their brains&hellip;</p>

        <p>And the great news is: Americas top anti-aging doctor now believes that virtually ANYONE can activate these power cells too&hellip;</p>
        <p>Meaning no matter how old you are, how rattled your memory may seem right now&hellip;</p>
        <p>Even if you're darn right forgetful more often than not&hellip; In just a few seconds per day&hellip;</p>
        <p>You could give your mind an incredible, natural boost&hellip;</p>
        <p>Something that brings it to life, and can have you feeling like its firing better than folks in their 20s and 30s.</p>
        <p>Youll be surprised at how simple it is to activate the millions of miniature “power cells” in the brain.</p>
        <p>In fact the simple daily ritual you're about to discover takes just seconds a day and is helping folks in their 40s or older to keep their minds razor sharp.</p>

        <p>Ive been practicing Internal Medicine for 26 years.</p>
        <p>Like Dr House from the TV show, I solve uncrackable health mysteries like a medical Sherlock Holmes.</p>
        <p>And one of the biggest riddles Ive tackled is the problem of brain fog.</p>
        <p>More and more patients are feeling spaced out, scattered and forgetful nowadays.</p>
        <p>And not elderly folks in their final years like youd expect, but younger people in their 40s, 50s and 60s.</p>
        <p>For some, its just the embarrassment of “Senior Moments” that worries them, but for others it gets downright scary&hellip;</p>
        <p>Making it hard to do their jobs, putting stress on their families, or even threatening their independence.</p>
        <p>But to solve the mystery, first we need to understand the real reason folks get brain fog.</p>

        <h1><strong>
            Where Do Thoughts
            &amp; Memories Come From?
        </strong></h1>

        <p>Thoughts and memories are basically made from electricity. Your brainwaves are pulses of electric current running through your brain cells.</p>
        <p>And each thought or memory is “coded” in a specific pattern of electric waves.</p>

        <p className="visual left desktop fancy">
            <Image src="web/i/visual-thought-source.jpg" alt=""/>
        </p>

        <p>So when someone says “cheesecake,” your brain creates specific electric patterns, and you “remember” the taste, the texture, and even how eating it makes you feel.</p>
        <p>But what if your brain runs low on electric charge? Or worse, what if the electric waves in your brain get “shorted out”?</p>

        <p className="visual center mobile fancy">
            <Image className="mobile-3of4-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-thought-source.jpg" alt=""/>
        </p>

        <p>Thats exactly what happens when someone has the word “cheesecake” on the tip of their tongue and it just wont come out.</p>
        <p>Thats what happens when folks forget their glasses are on their head, and then spend 5 minutes looking for them.</p>
        <p>In fact its the cause of all the brain fog and all the embarrassing “senior moments” folks may experience as they get older.</p>

                    How “Leaky Brain” Shorts Out
                    The Minds Power Supply
                </b></h1>
            </div>
            <div className="content">

                <p>Although the brain only makes up 2 percent of your body weight, it guzzles down a quarter of all your bodys energy!</p>
                <p>The body generates all that power inside something called <b>mitochondria</b> &mdash; tiny “organelles” in every cell that take the food you eat and the oxygen you breathe and turn it into the bodys power supply.</p>
                <p>To keep up with the huge demand for electricity, there are up to 2 million mitochondria inside every brain cell, which allows for the powerful electric pulses that form thoughts and retrieve memories.</p>

                <p className="visual right">
                    <Image className="mobile-3of4-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-mitocell.jpg" alt=""/>
                </p>

                <p>However mitochondria are very fragile, and can easily be corroded or even destroyed.</p>
                <p>Its for that reason that the brain is actually wrapped in a protective shield, called the Blood Brain Barrier, or BBB for short.</p>
                <p>Its supposed to stop toxins from getting into the brain and corroding your mitochondria.</p>
                <p>You can think of it like dropping your phone in a swimming pool. A newer phone would be waterproof and none the worse for wear. But an older or cheaper phone would get some water inside, shorting out the battery and ruining the circuitry.</p>
                <p>When that happens in the brain, its what most neuroscientists call “<b>Leaky Brain</b>.”</p>
                <p>It allows toxic slop to leak in, corroding mitochondria and disrupting healthy brainwaves.</p>
                <p>Its why most of the so-called “brain boosters” dont work.</p>

                </p>

                <p>But feeding them to a Leaky Brain is about as useful as putting more gas in a car with a dead battery&hellip;</p>
                <p>Because without the juice from the battery the engine wont run.</p>

        <h1><strong>
            Incredibly, A Natural Compound Found
            In Bee Hives Can Protect Against
            “Leaky Brain” &mdash; Giving a Boost To
            The Brains “Power Cells”
        </strong></h1>

        <p>I accidentally stumbled on this odd brain-power breakthrough while reviewing an article in the journal Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy.</p>
        <p>Stick with me for a second, because I didnt make the connection right away.</p>
        <p>The researchers revealed the results of a randomized, controlled study of 124 patients hospitalized during the pandemic.</p>
        <p>They were split into different groups so the researchers could find out if a natural compound called Brazilian Green Propolis would help them recover faster.</p>

        <div className="roundedbox blue">

            <p className="visual left desktop">
                <Image src="web/i/visual-bee.png" alt=""/>
            </p>

            <p className="visual left mobile">
                <Image className="mobile-1of3-width tablet-1of5-width" src="web/i/visual-bee-mobile.png" alt=""/>
            </p>

            <p>Propolis is a substance produced by bees, often called the “immune system of the hive.”</p>
            <p>But what caught my attention was the reason for the study. The researchers wrote: <i>“Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities&hellip;”</i></p>

        </div>

        <p>My research into the brains power supply already told me that limiting inflammation to healthy levels was key to dealing with brain fog. So it kept me reading.</p>
        <p>Some of the patients received daily doses of standardized Brazilian Green Propolis, while the rest served as the control and didnt get any propolis.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, the propolis group reduced their hospital stays by five to six days compared with the control group.</p>
        <p>But why did it have such a powerful effect?</p>

        <p className="visual right fancy">
            <Image className="mobile-4of5-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-ohio.png" alt=""/>
        </p>

        <p>When I started taking a closer look I discovered a research paper from Ohio State University that explained: <i>“Due to a broad spectrum of activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and antitumor effects&hellip; propolis has recently gained popularity as a natural product that may be potentially used as a therapeutic agent to improve health.”</i></p>
        <p>But could it help with Leaky Brain? It didnt take long to find the answer.</p>
        <p>I unearthed an article titled “The Neuroprotective Effects of Brazilian Green Propolis on Neurodegenerative Damage&hellip;”</p>
        <p>What I discovered is that not only does Brazilian Green Propolis help with maintaining healthy levels of inflammation. But the researchers also showed it can help protect human brain cells.</p>
        <p>Then another group of researchers did a wide-ranging review of all the studies done on the protective effects of propolis for brain health in both humans and animals.</p>

        <p className="visual left fancy">
            <Image className="mobile-4of5-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-fib.png" alt=""/>
        </p>

        <p>Based on all the existing science they concluded in the journal <i>Frontiers in Bioscience</i> that, <i>“propolis may be an effective candidate for the treatment of oxidative stress and <b>neuroinflammation</b>&hellip;”</i></p>
        <p>Its exactly what I was looking for.</p>
        <p>And isnt it so amazing how something bees make to protect their hive can end up providing such incredible protection for the brain?</p>
        <p>To be honest I probably could have stopped at Bee Propolis, and my patients would be in pretty good shape as far as healthy memory and focus is concerned.</p>
        <p>However my research also unearthed 9 more exciting ingredients that were too good to be ignored.</p>

            Out My Ultimate “Stack” For Healthy
            Memory &amp; Focus
        </strong></h1>

        <p>The first may surprise you, because a lot of people think its just a “sleep hormone.”</p>

        <div className="roundedbox transparent happyness">
            <h3 className="cl-blue ta-left mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center"><b>
                But new research shows Melatonins role is much bigger than we thought.
            </b></h3>
        </div>

        <p>In fact it only contributes to helping you fall asleep after the sun goes down.</p>
        <p>And the rest of the time it works hard at detoxing and cleansing your brain. So much so that one group of scientists dubbed it the “antioxidant that over delivers.”</p>
        <p>Antioxidants help mop up unstable molecules that cause damage in the body. Specifically these molecules can chew up and rip gaps in your Blood Brain Barrier and contribute to Leaky Brain.</p>
        <p>So when researchers looked at using melatonin to protect the BBB they found promising results. Before exposing little mouse brains to some highly inflammatory molecules, some of the mice were treated with melatonin.</p>

        <p className="visual right desktop fancy"><Image src="web/i/visual-cellphone.jpg" alt=""/></p>

        <p>And when they looked for the typical signs of Leaky Brain, the melatonin mice enjoyed a big reduction in any signs of BBB damage, but the other little guys werent so lucky.</p>

        <p className="visual center mobile fancy"><Image className="mobile-2of3-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-cellphone.jpg" alt=""/></p>

        <p>You can probably see why scientists cant do experiments like this on human brains. But since the BBBs of mice and humans are so similar, when the researchers presented their peer-reviewed findings in the prestigious PLOS ONE journal, they recommended melatonin as a potential option for brain injury in humans.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately most Americans dont produce nearly enough melatonin naturally.</p>
        <p>Thats because evening exposure to “blue light” from screens and especially LED bulbs shuts down your bodys ability to produce melatonin.</p>
        <p>Which means that folks miss out on the powerful detox for the brain.</p>
        <p>And its also why its more important than ever for folks to take the proper amount of pure and absorbable melatonin every evening.</p>
        <p>Now I probably could have stopped there, and already wed have an incredibly powerful solution to fight brain fog.</p>
        <p>Yet I couldnt stop thinking of a powerful little molecule we learn about in medical school, a special antioxidant made in your body called glutathione or GSH for short.</p>
        <p>It acts like fly paper, all the bad stuff sticks to it&hellip;</p>
        <p>Including the free radicals and toxins that poke holes in your blood brain barrier and corrode the mitochondria in your brain.</p>

        <div className="roundedbox transparent happyness2">
            <h3 className="cl-blue ta-left mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center"><b>
                There are more than 89,000 medical articles on the benefits of Glutathione.
            </b></h3>
        </div>

        <p>The bad news is that the American diet, pollution, toxins, medications, stress, infections, and radiation from electronics &mdash; just to name a few &mdash; all deplete your glutathione.</p>
        <p>When I looked into the benefits of GSH for a healthy brain it was a treasure trove.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the University of Denver demonstrated how glutathione can help the brain repair itself after traumatic injuries like concussions.</p>
        <p>And another study published in the <i>Journal Neurochemical Research</i> showed that higher levels of glutathione could protect the Blood Brain Barrier from damage.</p>

        <p className="visual left desktop fancy"><Image src="web/i/visual-lab.jpg" alt=""/></p>

        <p>But there was just one problem with glutathione&hellip;</p>
        <p>See, its almost impossible to absorb the supplement form.</p>

        <p className="visual center mobile fancy"><Image className="mobile-2of3-width tablet-1of3-width" src="web/i/visual-lab.jpg" alt=""/></p>

        <p>Which is why most doctors dont know how to increase your GSH.</p>
        <p>And the only reason why it wasnt the very first thing I tried for brain fog.</p>
        <p>But in the meantime another group of biologists studied a new form of GSH, and demonstrated it is actually super easy for humans to absorb it.</p>
        <p>Its called S-acetyl-glutathione, or SAG for short.</p>
        <p>In a single dose, randomised, cross-over, human bioavailability study they found this new form of glutathione is taken up easily and directly into the cells.</p>
        <p>So although authentic SAG supplements are hard to find, I believe everyone over 40 should be taking one daily.</p>
        <p>And along with Brazilian bee propolis and just the right amount of melatonin&hellip;</p>
        <p>My patients reported some pretty astonishing results.</p>
        <p>But thats just the start.</p>
        <p>You see my research uncovered an additional 7 ingredients that all show immense promise when it comes to supporting your mitochondria and protecting your blood brain barrier.</p>
        <p>These ingredients are&hellip;</p>

        <div className="roundedbox ingredient reishi">
            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                <b>Reishi Mushrooms</b>, also called "mushrooms of immortality," which have been shown to have a powerful neuroprotective effect and even protect from mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain.

            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                <b>Curcumin, Selenium, Vitamin C, and Ginseng</b> because they are all powerful antioxidants that show a strong protective effect on the blood brain barrier.

        </div>

        <div className="roundedbox ingredient dc">
            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                <b>Duchesnea Chrysantha</b>, which contains amazing little molecules called pentacyclic triterpenes that mop up a nasty menace called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs for short)&hellip;
            </p>
            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                Think of AGEs as rust on your brain that is corrosive to your mitochondria.
            </p>

        <div className="roundedbox ingredient zinc">
            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                And finally <b>Zinc</b> because researchers at Duke University and MIT discovered it plays a critical role in communication between the cells in the brain that form memories.

            <p className="mobile-ta-center tablet-ta-center">
                When folks take the optimal form of these 10 “super” nutrients they quickly experience a noticeable boost to focus and memory.
            </p>

        <p>But heres the thing, given the science behind all of these ingredients youd think doctors everywhere would be recommending them to their patients.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately thats not the case.</p>

        <div className="roundedbox dark-blue mskt">
            <p>Most doctors write brain fog off as a normal part of aging, or worse, pull out their prescription pads.</p>
            <p>But as science shows that these can come with className="mobile-hidden" a laundry list of side effects that rob folks of their className="mobile-hidden" energy and happiness.</p>
            <p>So when you consider how these natural ingredients className="mobile-hidden" can help keep the brains “power cells” working at className="mobile-hidden" their best, and protect from “Leaky Brain,” why className="mobile-hidden"arent more people using them?</p>
            <p>Well it turns out part of the problem is cost. Because className="mobile-hidden" when I recommended these to patients it would className="mobile-hidden" sometimes cost them as much as $300 to buy className="mobile-hidden" all the nutrients separately.</p>
            <p>So no matter how amazing it could make them feel, it simply wasnt affordable.</p>

        <p>At the time Todd was struggling to earn his helicopter pilots licence, and in his late 40s he felt like he was missing the mental edge he needed.</p>
        <p>He tried caffeine pills but they just left him shaky and frazzled. So-called brain boosters only made his skin tingle but didnt improve his focus. And meditating just put him to sleep.</p>
        <p>So he was excited to learn about my stack of nutrients to power up the brain. And even more excited by how he felt once he started taking them.</p>
        <p>And just mere months later, Todd finally had his helicopter licence. He gave a lot of credit to the mental clarity he felt from using the stack of 10 natural nutrients we just covered.</p>
        <p>And he vowed that together wed make sure that this incredible combination of natural ingredients became available and affordable to anyone who needs them.</p>

                <p><b>How Much Should You Take Each Day?</b></p>
                <p>Pure Neuro is made in a GMP certified facility, and then each batch of finished Pure Neuro is tested again by an independent laboratory to ensure that what's seen on the bottle is what's found on the inside.</p>
                <p>Pure Neuro is also gluten free, soy free, dairy free, and GMO free.</p>

                <p className="visual right desktop"><Image src="web/i/visual-features.png" alt=""/></p>
                <p className="visual center mobile"><Image className="mobile-full-width tablet-half-width" src="web/i/visual-features-mobile.png" alt=""/></p>

                <p>On top of that, the popularity of Pure Neuro is increasing daily as people spread the word. And its putting a serious strain on our limited production.</p>
                <p>Folks of all ages are discovering the benefits of Pure Neuro, so they keep ordering several bottles of pure neuro at a time. Which makes it difficult for us to keep up with demand.</p>
                <p>For these reasons Out-of-Stocks are always a risk. Which is why we recommend stocking up.</p>
                <p>In just a moment Ill share how you can secure your own supply today.</p>
                <p><b>How Much Pure Neuro Should You Take Every Day?</b></p>
                <p>This is actually pretty straight forward&hellip;</p>
                <p>Just take 2 capsules every evening after dinner&hellip;</p>
                <p>And thats literally all it takes!</p>
                <p>And heres why its important to keep taking Pure Neuro for as long as you can. Its true that the potent natural ingredients inside of Pure Neuro get to work immediately to help keep the Blood Brain Barrier healthy.</p>
                <p>It provides the mitochondria with the nutrients they need to maintain a healthy power production in the brain.</p>
                <p>Which means the longer folks take it the better, because protecting the brain from toxins and keeping the mitochondria healthy is key to long term healthy memory and focus.</p>

                <p className="visual left"><Image src="web/i/single-bottle.jpg" alt=""/></p>

                <p>Its for all of these reasons that I personally recommend choosing at least 3 bottles of Pure Neuro (a 90 Day Supply)&hellip;</p>
                <p>And 6 bottles (a 180 Day Supply) for the best chance at staying sharp as a tack for as long as possible.</p>
                <p>Look: Ive seen the toll brain fog can have on unsuspecting Americans. Its heartbreaking to see folks suffer the embarrassment and fear. Ive seen relationships crumble  under the weight of arguments, flaring tempers and neglect that come from the complications of brain fog.</p>
                <p>Ive seen folks lose their jobs or mismanage their money because they were too scattered to keep track of it all, eventually going broke, losing their homes, or even going bankrupt.</p>
                <p>And saddest of all, Ive seen folks lose their independence and zest for life.</p>
                <p>I dont want folks to needlessly suffer like that. Especially when preventing Leaky Brain takes just seconds a day.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>That's why I truly believe that so many Americans can benefit from Pure Neuro. And why I recommend that everyone over 40 should make it part of their daily routine right away.</p>
        <p>Which is why I want to make it easy for folks to say YES to Pure Neuro today.</p>
        <p>So when you secure a supply today, you can get your very own bottle of Pure Neuro for a one-time investment of just $59&hellip;</p>
        <p>But thats just the beginning. I realize that many people may want to keep taking Pure Neuro for years to come.</p>
        <p>Plus I truly believe everyone over 40 needs to start taking Pure Neuro daily.</p>
        <p><b>And I personally will be taking it every day for the rest of my life</b>, because I understand that my mental agility is priceless.</p>
        <p>Its for this reason that we created a substantially discounted multi-bottle plan, where folks can stock up and save on 6 bottles of Pure Neuro&hellip;</p>

        <p className="visual right"><Image className="mobile-3of4-width tablet-half-width" src="web/i/visual-limited.png" alt=""/></p>

        <p>For just $39 per bottle&hellip;</p>
        <p>But this special discount is only being offered here on this page.</p>
        <p>And because of limited stock we really have to limit each customer to just 6 bottles at a time.</p>
        <p>Plus, as part of my vow to make this utterly affordable, were giving you free shipping and handling when you save on multiple bottles. Which is a further $14.95 value for free.</p>
        <p>Just select your preferred savings option below and tap the corresponding button to get started.</p>
        <p>Well get your order of Pure Neuro out to you immediately so you can enjoy the benefits for yourself.</p>
